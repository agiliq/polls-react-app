react-scripts
===============

react-scripts is an NPM package specifically for use with create-react-app. It's the "black box" which contains the essentials:

Dependencies
++++++++++++++++

* Like Babel, ESLint, and Webpack.


Configuration
++++++++++++++++

* Config files for Webpack, Babel and ESLint, both for development and production.

Scripts
++++++++++

* For instance, the command react-scripts start runs a script shipped with this package. It's responsible for ultimately booting the Webpack development server.


To see it in action, we can run npm start from inside of this folder:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ cd npm start

This will launch a Webpack dev server and should also open localhost:3000 in your browser if you're on a Mac:
